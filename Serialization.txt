serializable

1. class has to implement java.io.Serializable
2. class has to override methods like writeObject(), readObject()
3. All instance variable has to copied by default but if any reference object presents in class, which needs to manually serialized in writeObject method
4. readObject() method read data in which order wirteObject() writes
5. transient and static modifier used to restrict serialization to specific filed.
6. To avoid serialization for child of parent (which implements Serializable), writeObjcet() should include "throw new NotSerializableException();" in child class
7. serialVersionUID is used to control version of class file while doing serialization and de-serialization process.
