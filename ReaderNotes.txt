Java

 - Declaring instance variable with access modifier private is known as data hiding or information 
 hiding.
 
 - Each public class declaration must be stored in a file having the same name as the class and 
 ending with the .java filename extension;
 
 - Why main() is static? - In Java world, no way to invoke a method of class (here it is main()) 
 without object, so static is the only option available for JVM. Assume that JVM has to call a main()
  without static modifier, it needs to create an object of the class which may tend to end up 
 with impossible situation like a class doesn't have default constructor, it has only parameterized 
 constructor. Eventually, JVM can't find what input to give to the constructor of the class (where 
 main() method resides) in order to create object for calling main() method.
